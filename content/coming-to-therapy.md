I believe that asking for help takes a lot of courage and can be a daunting
prospect, so let me tell you a little more of what to expect should you decide
to get in touch. Firstly we can arrange a free initial consultation, by phone
at a mutually agreed time.(or via message or email if you prefer) This will
give me a broad understanding of what you want to work on and whether I can
help. It will also give you the opportunity to ask any questions and get a
sense of whether you feel we can work together before committing to your first
appointment.

Research shows that the success of any therapy experience is very much related
to the quality of the therapeutic relationship and I believe I bring a non
judgemental, warm and kindly approach to sessions, infused with a little
humour!

How many sessions you need to come for very much depends on your problem and
what you've chosen to work on.  CBT is not a quick fix approach, though
relatively short term and Nice Guidelines usually advise between 6 and 16
sessions, with attendance on a weekly basis. It isn't unusual for people to
come for a course of CBT and then return a year or so later for booster
sessions to reinforce or develop previous learning.

CBT is very much a collaborative approach, so the first stage of therapy is to
develop a shared understanding of your problem.  The first couple of sessions
will usually involve developing an overview of what is problematic in terms of
thoughts, feelings and behaviour, identifying vicious cycles, as well as a
consideration of the roots of the problem, how the past informs the present.
We can then map out a tailor made Treatment Plan, based on your hopes for
therapy and what is realistic within the agreed time frame. CBT is a proactive
therapy so further sessions will involve you learning skills and strategies
alongside values based goal setting and problem solving.  You will be supported
in actively practising these skills between sessions ready for further
reflection and fine tuning when you return. CBT is all about coaching people to
become their own therapist, so towards the end of therapy we will develop a
plan for handling setbacks and promoting emotional resilience. My nursing
background enables me to offer an holistic approach to your difficulties,
taking into account physical health conditions and the role of medications
prescribed for mood management.

## Testimonials

I found it strange that I didn't see how I was changing as I spiralled
downwards.  It was such a gradual change that it went by unnoticed.  I was
putting things off that I would normally enjoy doing but decided that I would
do them when I felt a bit better, I just couldn’t be bothered.  It wasn’t
until I talked to Bridget that I understood that I needed to do these things
in order to feel better.  Once I started doing small, little things, then I
started to feel more like my old self.  I found that I had more energy and
enthusiasm for the day ahead.

It wasn’t until I had come back up a bit that I realised how shutdown I had
become.  I can now take the time to enjoy my surroundings, take time to have a
conversation in the evening instead of disappearing into an Ipad and make time
to do some ‘me’ things. Thanks very much Bridget, I feel a whole lot better about myself and my situation.

Bridget helped me through a very dark and difficult time in my life. I can’t
thank her enough for her guidance and compassion  but also for the way she
challenged me to see the truth of my situation. I am enjoying life now and
looking forward to living my life with more self-compassion and patience.
Thank you.

For several years I had tried a variety of therapies with little sustained
success.  From the Beginning working with Bridget my experience changed.  She
introduced me to both new ways of thinking and behaviours which gave me
practical strategies of help. Routinely she supplemented our sessions with
additional information which ensured enhanced support. I am grateful to
Bridget for her help and support and have no hesitation in recommending her to
others.

<p>
I wanted to say thank you for your help over the past few months.  I have been
managing anxiety issues for many years, and tried various things, but I have
found the techniques you have taught me to be very effective.  I feel so much
more optimistic now I know I have a ‘toolkit’ to help me when life gets
difficult in the future.

I have been having counselling with Bridget since June 2020 and cannot thank
her enough for her help and wisdom. Bridget is totally professional,
compassionate and approachable. Her CBT methods are well explained by her and
easily accessible. She provides really helpful resources to user at home. As I
now finish I feel stronger emotionally and mentally and have more confidence
to accept myself and others and hence move forward into the future with a
wiser, more accepting attitude. Life may not be perfect but Bridget has
definitely helped and enabled me to face the future with a more positive
attitude and more confidence. I recommend her to anyone who needs help. I
definitely could not have done it without her!

<p>
As someone who experienced anxiety in the past, the pandemic really
exacerbated things and had a big impact on my mental health, seriously
affecting my studies and day-to-day life. I realised that I wasn't coping on
my own and needed help. By the time I got in touch with Bridget, I had never
had therapy before and I’m so glad I did! Bridget was very warm and welcoming
from the start. She has a fun and engaging way of explaining how our tricky
human minds work and gives you the right tools to approach difficult thoughts
and feelings in a different, more compassionate way. I’m so grateful to have
met and worked with Bridget, I can't recommend her enough!

<p>
I have continued to put into practice much of the tools I learnt with you.
Self- compassion in particular has been an absolute life-saver and I am
incredibly grateful to you for all of our sessions together. I learnt such a
lot and it helped me through the very difficult year of 2020. You were always
without fail kind, compassionate and supportive and I wanted to thank you so
much for everything.

Working with Bridget has more fully enabled me to understand and accept the
ways in which anxiety impacts my life and it has given me tools to manage and
deal with it more effectively in the future.

After hitting emotional rock bottom last year, I had tried a handful of
counselling sessions elsewhere but felt like I was not progressing hugely or
able to make any 'next steps' to get my life back on track. Somebody
recommended CBT to me along with ACT as potential forms of therapy, and through
some research I discovered Bridget in Malvern. Despite the current climate of
the world and the majority of our counselling sessions having to be conducted
long distance, Bridget went out of
her way to be there for me both as a counselor and for emotional support
throughout, and has subsequently helped me through some of the most challenging
months of my life. Through compassion therapy, 'self kindness', meditation
exercises and understanding of the psychology behind negative thoughts and
feelings, I now have a much greater understanding of myself, my own emotions
and how to move forwards, even if small steps, towards happiness. Thank you
Bridget - I certainly couldn't have done any of it without you and will
definitely be following up when I next need to 'drop anchor' again!

I started seeing Ms Bridget Maddison when I was at the lowest point of my life
when I could feel anxious easily and could not carry out the very basic day to
day tasks such as shopping or collecting kids from school. The CBT based
approach helped me HUGELY as I gradually realised that all my symptoms actually
stemmed from my worry and fear rather than physical illness. Once I started
accepting that, my condition just started getting better day by day.

I found Bridget very easy to speak to and such a good listener, which to me is
really important as when I was anxious I really don't need any more distress.
She always kept me relaxed during the therapy but at the same time she did try
to bring me back to the schedule she has set up for the session, which is also
really important for me to receive the best cure I needed at the time.  Before
the end of each season, she always gave me some handouts to bring home for
self-read and self-help. Thus I could always learn a bit more during the two
sessions.

All in all, I'm very happy to recommend Bridget to anyone who is suffering from
anxiety issues. I also would like to say to anyone who is reading this
testimonial. You can bring your life back and be normal again. To me, my
anxiety issue is just a wake-up call. It is not a bad thing when I look back.
Now I live a much healthier and happier life thanks to the anxiety issue I had
just a few months ago.

Bridget's therapy was so helpful to me. When I first went to see her my head
was all over the place and I just kept getting thoughts that I couldn't stop
and that just kept spiralling out of control and giving me horrible feelings I
had never experienced before. I was getting mood swings and being snappy at
home without understanding why and sometimes without realising. Bridget was
able to get to the bottom of these issues and help me to understand why I was
feeling like I did and to understand that it was anxiety that I was living
with. Then with the help of Bridget's 8 week CBT course I was able to get a
hold of these feelings and learn to accept them, not push them away, learn
what they felt like and develop techniques that allowed me to live with the
feelings and not let them take over me. I would definitely recommend Bridget
to anybody that struggles with mental health  issues and she really has
changed my life.

I contacted Bridget after experiencing moments of anxiety at work, my doctor
mentioned that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy could be really useful - it
certainly is! I found Bridget’s approach very understanding and proactive. I
feel I know much more about myself, how the brain operates and how we can work
together more effectively. I believe I have acquired life skill which I will
continue to develop.  </p>

<p>
I would highly recommend Bridget to anyone considering CBT counselling. She 
has really helped me to better understand myself and has given me a virtual 
bag of tools with which to move forward with confidence and choose how to be.
Her manner is very supportive and non- judgemental and I found it very easy to 
understand the concepts and incorporate
them into daily life. If, as they say, life is a journey, my experience with 
Bridget was like picking up a map and a compass after storms had beaten me 
down. It doesn't change the weather or the boat you are in, but you have some 
tools to allow you to choose how get you where, and how, you would like to 
be.

Having suffered with OCD for 20 years I sought Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
and Bridget came into my life as a blessing! She handled my situation with 
great care and empathy and used her extensive skills to teach me and guide me 
into dealing with my OCD and learning how to free myself from some of the 
debilitating symptoms that it causes. Bridget is professional and thorough and 
puts everything into helping you to heal yourself. She is compassionate yet 
tough when she knows that you need to be tough! She has given me tools & 
skills that enabled me to get my life back. She is incredible! If you need 
her, go and see her, you will be so thankful you did!

I want to thank you for the time that you have given to me over the last
months.
</p>

<p>
This is the first time that I have needed professional help. When I first came
to you I could not envisage a positive outcome or a time when I would be able
to return to my old self.  However, thanks to your wise counsel,  vision,
support and teaching I now have many new skills developed during our CBT
sessions that I use daily. I  truly believe that I will not be returning to my
old self but in fact a new, better and more fulfilled self.
</p>

<p>
Bridget, my family and I are eternally grateful to you for our time together.
