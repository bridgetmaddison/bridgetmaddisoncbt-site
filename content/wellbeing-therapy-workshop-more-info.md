+++
Most of us know the changes we want to make to be our healthier selves but we often struggle to do things differently.

Over the 8 weeks, this workshop will enable you to understand why this is the
case. We start with an informed and yet compassionate understanding of how our
modern world environment works against us. Learn about the basic needs of the
‘cooperative primate’ and find ways to build patterns of practice that you can
integrate into your daily life that will meet your ‘monkey needs’!

This workshop is designed to problem solve our finite resources of time,
finance, energy…. these are things that we need to build changes around. The
emphasis is on identifying and integrating small workable actions that can
build into patterns and hopefully habits. This approach sees ‘failure’ as part
of the learning process, providing opportunities to notice what happened and
get ready with awareness for next time.

Personalise your steps for change with your ‘Wellbeing Matrix’ - an awareness
tool, that trains you to bring you Values into your day to day experience and
become more alert to  what shows up and gets in the way of you doing the
things that would make life better.

We use Metaphor  to see things more clearly and promote change. Consider your
‘Wellbeing Garden’, which bits are being neglected, what are the ‘birds’ that
swoop down and stop new growth?!

The workshops are practical and each session involves mindfulness based
exercises so you can notice your ‘chattering mind’ and become more open to
feelings or sensations that might want to take you off track from you pathway
to wellbeing.

We draw on the brain science of Compassion and how taking the perspective of
the Kindly Companion means we can more effectively coach ourselves through the
tricky times and celebrate!

The Wellbeing Menu enables you personalise the group experience as you choose
where to focus your attention but also promotes a holistic approach to
wellbeing -  creating the conditions for feeling better thus more likely to
withstand life’s ups and downs.

Commit to weekly tasks to build patterns of change and log to share with group
members. Every session includes a ‘Pattern Builder’ - one small change to
integrate into your week.
