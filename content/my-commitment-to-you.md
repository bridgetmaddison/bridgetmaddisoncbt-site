I have an Enhanced DBS Status (Disclosure and Barring Service, formerly CRB 
Criminal Record Bureau Check). This is renewed annually.

## Professional Bodies
I will uphold the requirements of Accreditation by the British Association of
Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapists (BABCP) and Registration by the
Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). This requires my commitment to regular
attendance of ongoing professional development courses and accessing regular
Clinical Supervision.

## Confidentiality
I guarantee our sessions will remain strictly private and confidential in line
with the ethical standards of the BABCP.  The only  exception to this would be
if you tell me something that makes me very concerned about your safety or the
safety of someone else. In that case, I would have gained your agreement in the
first session to share my concerns with a designated family member or
Professional. This would usually be a step we would plan together to enable you
to access the further help you need.

To improve my Service to you and as part of the requirements of my Professional
Body, I may review our sessions with my Clinical Supervisor. Your anonymity
will be maintained throughout and the Supervisor is also bound to keep your
information confidential.

## Data Storage
I will store your data electronically and make use of two-factor authentication
for all services involved in storing your data. I am a registered Data
Controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 and I
operate in accordance with its legal requirements.

## Insurance
I hold Professional Insurance (professional indemnity and public liability).
