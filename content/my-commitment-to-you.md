I have an Enhanced DBS Status (Disclosure and Barring Service, formerly CRB 
Criminal Record Bureau Check). This is renewed annually.

## Professional Bodies
I will uphold the requirements of Accreditation by the British Association of
Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapists (BABCP) and Registration by the
Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). This requires my commitment to regular
attendance of ongoing professional development courses and accessing regular
Clinical Supervision.

## Confidentiality

I guarantee our sessions will remain strictly private and confidential in line
with the ethical standards of the BABCP. The only exception to this would be if
you tell me something that makes me very concerned about your safety or the
safety of someone else. In that case, I would have gained your agreement in the
first session to share my concerns with a designated family member or
Professional. This would usually be a step we would plan together to enable you
to access the further help you need.

To improve my Service to you and as part of the requirements of my Professional
Body, I may review our sessions with my Clinical Supervisor. Your anonymity
will be maintained throughout and the Supervisor is also bound to keep your
information confidential.

I do have a legal obligation to break confidentiality in compliance with a
court order, concerns over child protection or the needs of a vulnerable adult,
as well as information or knowledge regarding fraud, drug trafficking or acts
of terrorism.

## Data Storage
As a registered Data Controller, I will store your personal information
electronically and make use of two-factor authentication for all services
involved to ensure the data is secure and confidential. The data collected is
used to enable effective communication during the therapeutic process, it is
used in a safe and ethical manner and is in line with EU General Data
Protection (GDPR) 2018. You have the right to ask for a copy of your personal
information, also the right to ask me to amend or change any incorrect
information about you. You have the right to ask me to erase any information
that I hold about you. This includes your personal information that is no
longer relevant to original purposes, or if you wish to withdraw consent. In
all cases and when considering such requests, these rights are obligatory
unless it is information that I have a legal obligation to retain.

As a condition of my Insurance Policy, session notes will be held securely and
confidentially for 7 years after the therapeutic process has ended, or in the
case of a minor (under 18) 7 years after reaching their 18th birthday.

## Informed Consent and Agreement
I will ask you to sign a statement at our initial session to confirm you are
happy with the way your personal information is collected, stored and used.

## Insurance
I hold Professional Insurance (professional indemnity and public liability).
