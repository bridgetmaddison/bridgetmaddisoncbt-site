## More about CBT

**Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy (CBT)** is a scientifically proven talking
therapy that can help people with a wide range of difficulties. It is
recommended in the NICE guidelines (National Institute for Clinical Excellence)
as an effective treatment for Anxiety based problems and Depression. CBT
explores how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes impacts on what you do and
feel and how a greater understanding of these cycles and processes can lead you
towards solutions and change. CBT tends to be more focused on the present but
might also look at your past to help you understand how your past impacts on
the present. Find out more about the problems that can be effectively treated
with CBT under [About You]({{< ref "about-you.md" >}}).

Over recent years I have been increasingly drawn to **Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT)**. This falls under the 'umbrella' of CBT and is often referred to
as one of the 'third wave' family of Cognitive Behavioural Therapies. What I
love about ACT and why I've begun to use it more in my Practice, is that
alongside its growing evidence base and great feedback from patients, I know
how much more prepared I am myself to handle life's challenges, through using
these skills and ideas! It is also particularly helpful when you are
experiencing a number of problems at the same time or your problems are
longstanding.

## What is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?

<img src="/img/acthands.jpg" style="width: 40%; height: auto; background-size: cover;"/>

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy gets its name from its main themes** - to
accept things that are out of your control and commit to changing things
that can be changed to make your life better. In summary, ACT uses
mindfulness and acceptance skills to develop a more flexible relationship
with your thoughts, feelings, memories and sensations. Time is also taken
to clarify what gives your life meaning, your values. Without being held
back by tricky thoughts and feelings and with a new sense of purpose and
direction, you can begin to build a more enriched and meaningful life.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (say Act, not A.C.T.!) is an engaging and
playful approach to tackling life's difficulties. Just like traditional
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, it is underpinned by a growing body of
scientific evidence highlighting its effectiveness for many psychological
problems and challenges.

**ACT draws on brain science** to show we are all wired to 'suffer' or find
life difficult because we are designed to pay attention to anything we
perceive as threat. This explains why we often find ourselves caught up in
our in our 'chattering' mind, over-thinking ourselves, our problems or
disturbed by our feelings. We are also programmed to find solutions, to
deal with the 'threat', (in this case our thoughts and feelings), so we are
naturally compelled to distract ourselves from this tricky stuff or avoid
things that lead them to show up in the first place.

**This gets us caught up in unhelpful vicious cycles**, like comfort eating,
relying on alcohol, retail therapy, spending too long watching shows,
checking social media, sleeping or overworking... the list is long! In Act we
call this, **The Struggle**, when in an effort not to feel or think we end up
doing things or not doing things that take us away from the person we want
to be or the life we want to lead. (Clearly most of these things are fine
in moderation!). These ineffective coping strategies often play a key part
in maintaining things like anxiety, depression and low self esteem and may
cost us dearly in terms of time, energy, money, health and relationships.

## How does it help?

The research underpinning Acceptance and Commitment Therapy shows that we
are also pre-programmed with the capacity to develop skills to work through
life's challenges - there is hope! In sessions you will **learn key skills** to
enable you to step back from your chattering mind and what may be at times
toxic thinking and learn ways to have and handle uncomfortable or painful
feelings. Through mindfulness and acceptance skills, use of metaphor,
experiential exercises and the development of self compassion, we will
actively construct a new way for you to respond to long-standing habits and
reactions that you know are not helping. If your life has grown narrower,
we will draw on tried and tested behavioural strategies such as Graded
Exposure and Behavioural Activation to enable you to move TOWARDS things
you may have been avoiding.

These skills help promote what ACT refers to as **PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY**,
which is all about trying to build a new relationship with difficult
thoughts, feelings and sensations, one that doesn't rely on avoidance or
distraction. In essence, this means we are less stressed/distressed and
able to do more of what we value, giving us a greater sense of meaning,
purpose and therefore, well-being


## Change or connecting to what matters

If battling with our difficulties pulls us away from how we want our lives
to be then getting things on track needs to take into account our 'bigger
picture' â€“ what is important to us in life. Taking time to identify your
values will enable you to set meaningful goals, giving you a greater sense
of purpose and can become a motivator when things are tricky. From my
experience this work also helps people appreciate what they already have in
their lives right now. ACT is also a really practical therapy of change so
if moving forward involves learning new skills or solving problems we can
consider this too.

## Mindfulness and ACT
Here is a little more information on how mindfulness is used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

It tends to be more 'bite-sized' based on research that shows that even brief
periods of regular mindfulness practice (5- 10 mins or just mini mindful
moments!) can still be beneficial and help us to 'rewire' our brain. 

<blockquote>While many people think mindfulness means meditation, this is not the case.
Mindfulness is a mental state of openness, awareness and focus, and meditation
is just one way amongst hundreds of learning to cultivate this 
state.</blockquote>
_Russ Harris_

ACT breaks Mindfulness down into 4 key skills:

1. Defusion - distancing from and letting go of unhelpful thoughts, beliefs,
memories, images, rules for living etc.


2. Willingness - making room for painful feelings, urges and sensations, and
allowing them to come and go without a struggle.


3. Contact with the present moment: engaging fully with our here and now
experience, with an attitude of openness and curiosity. Getting better at being
connected to the here and now and the things we value.

4. Being the Observer of our experience so we are no longer defined by it. Not
caught up in unhelpful stories of ourselves based on our past or our fears.
