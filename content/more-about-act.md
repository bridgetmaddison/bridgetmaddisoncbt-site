## More about CBT

**Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy (CBT)** is a scientifically proven
talking therapy that can help people with a wide range of difficulties. It is
recommended in the NICE guidelines (National Institute for Clinical
Excellence) as an effective treatment for Anxiety based problems and
Depression. CBT explores how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes
impacts on what you do and feel and how a greater understanding of
these cycles and processes can lead you towards solutions and change.
CBT tends to be more focused on the present but can refer to the past to
better understand how it impacts on the here and now.

The Third wave family of Cognitive Behavioural Therapies includes
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or ACT and Compassion
Focused Therapy (amongst others). I am able to draw from this
innovative body of knowledge with its growing evidence base to ensure
you get a tailor-made therapy suited to your particular needs. ACT uses
Mindfulness and Acceptance skills to help you negotiate what gets in the
way of what matters to you, whilst Compassion Focused Therapy has a
focus on responding kindly and wisely to the inner critic and painful
feelings.
I hope you choose to read further but in essence, CBT is really about
becoming your own inner coach and brain trainer! so you can do more of
what’s healthy and helpful in your life and less of the things that aren’t
working. Find out more about the problems that can be effectively treated
with CBT under [About You]({{< ref "about-you.md" >}}).


## What is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?

<img src="/img/acthands.jpg" style="width: 40%; height: auto; background-size: cover;"/>

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy gets its name from its main themes** - to
accept things that are out of your control and commit to changing things
that can be changed to make your life better. In summary, ACT uses
mindfulness and acceptance skills to develop a more flexible relationship
with your thoughts, feelings, memories and sensations. Time is also taken
to clarify what gives your life meaning, your values. Without being held
back by tricky thoughts and feelings and with a new sense of purpose and
direction, you can begin to build a more enriched and meaningful life.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (say Act, not A.C.T.!) is an engaging and
playful approach to tackling life's difficulties. Just like traditional
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, it is underpinned by a growing body of
scientific evidence highlighting its effectiveness for many psychological
problems and challenges.

**ACT draws on brain science** to show we are all wired to 'suffer' or find
life difficult because we are designed to pay attention to anything we
perceive as threat. This explains why we often find ourselves caught up in
our in our 'chattering' mind, over-thinking ourselves, our problems or
disturbed by our feelings. We are also programmed to find solutions, to
deal with the 'threat', (in this case our thoughts and feelings), so we are
naturally compelled to distract ourselves from this tricky stuff or avoid
things that lead them to show up in the first place.

**This gets us caught up in unhelpful vicious cycles**, like comfort eating,
relying on alcohol, retail therapy, spending too long watching shows,
checking social media, sleeping or overworking... the list is long! In Act we
call this, **The Struggle**, when in an effort not to feel or think we end up
doing things or not doing things that take us away from the person we want
to be or the life we want to lead. (Clearly most of these things are fine
in moderation!). These ineffective coping strategies often play a key part
in maintaining things like anxiety, depression and low self esteem and may
cost us dearly in terms of time, energy, money, health and relationships.

## How does it help?

The research underpinning Acceptance and Commitment Therapy shows that we
are also pre-programmed with the capacity to develop skills to work through
life's challenges - there is hope! In sessions you will **learn key skills** to
enable you to step back from your chattering mind and what may be at times
toxic thinking and learn ways to have and handle uncomfortable or painful
feelings. Through mindfulness and acceptance skills, use of metaphor,
experiential exercises and the development of self compassion, we will
actively construct a new way for you to respond to long-standing habits and
reactions that you know are not helping. If your life has grown narrower,
we will draw on tried and tested behavioural strategies such as Graded
Exposure and Behavioural Activation to enable you to move TOWARDS things
you may have been avoiding.

These skills help promote what ACT refers to as **PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY**,
which is all about trying to build a new relationship with difficult
thoughts, feelings and sensations, one that doesn't rely on avoidance or
distraction. In essence, this means we are less stressed/distressed and
able to do more of what we value, giving us a greater sense of meaning,
purpose and therefore, well-being


## Change or connecting to what matters

If battling with our difficulties pulls us away from how we want our lives
to be then getting things on track needs to take into account our 'bigger
picture' – what is important to us in life. Taking time to identify your
values will enable you to set meaningful goals, giving you a greater sense
of purpose and can become a motivator when things are tricky. From my
experience this work also helps people appreciate what they already have in
their lives right now. ACT is also a really practical therapy of change so
if moving forward involves learning new skills or solving problems we can
consider this too.

## What is Compassion Focused Therapy?
Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) aims to help promote mental and
emotional healing by encouraging people in treatment to be
compassionate toward themselves and other people. It is another
member of the wider family of Cognitive Behavioural Therapies and was
founded by Professor Paul Gilbert.

Like ACT, CFT emphasises the inherent difficulty of our evolved Tricky
Brains which can make us our own worst critic. Compassion Focused
Therapy is particularly relevant to those who experience feelings of
shame or guilt and self-critical thinking. Many people feel able to
respond in a kindly and supportive fashion to others but struggle to
motivate themselves in this way. Although the word Compassion makes
us think of qualities like kindness and warmth, this approach also places
great emphasis on the strength and courage it takes to engage with our
suffering and do something about it. CFT presents Compassion as a skill
that can be developed and nurtured through Compassionate Focused
Exercises and Practice.

## What is Mindfulness

Ever noticed how you get caught up in your head, thinking about the
next thing to do, worrying or re-living the past. Experts say we spend up
to 47% of our waking moments in autopilot! Mindfulness is a way of
training your mind to be more aware of the here and now so we can
actually live life in the present. It enables us to hold attention where we
choose, rather than what our thoughts or feelings dictate. Its aim is not
to try and control or suppress our thoughts or distract from our feelings
but to enable us to see them for what they are – mental events. Learning
to look at our thoughts rather than from them means we no longer have
to over identify with what our mind is telling us. If we can learn to notice
our experiences, take a step back, we are freed to choose how we want
to respond. This increases the likelihood that we can start acting in ways
that are more healthy and helpful and move us towards a better life.
Finally, Mindfulness enables us to be more present in those moments
that really matter, so we can appreciate them in all their glory rather than
being "there but not there".

As a Therapist I’m a great believer in "practice what you preach" so do
my best to commit to a daily mindfulness practice. I hope this increases
my own capacity to be open, present and aware within a Therapy
Session.

## Me and Mindfulness

I am committed to developing my practice and understanding of mindfulness, and
over the last few years have completed training with the [Breathworks
Mindfulness Organisation](https://www.breathworks-mindfulness.org.uk).

Breathworks is a charitable organisation providing evidence based mindfulness
and compassion focused programmes for individuals and organisations as well an
Accredited Teacher Training programme. My training prepares me for teaching
the Mindfulness for Health and Mindfulness for Stress Courses. Training
includes learning within week long Residential Retreats, Residential Movement
Meditation training and supporting a local 8 week course alongside commitment
to individual practice and supportive Supervision. I plan to finalise my
training this year.

## Individual Mindfulness Training

The Mindfulness for Health and Little Mindfulness Workbook can form the basis of an
individual programme which we can work through together supported by in session
practice alongside access to the free online meditations and downloadable exercise
sheets linked to books. This gives you the opportunity to gain from an evidence based
programme with the benefit of an individual learning experience tailored to your needs
and interests.

"Clinical trials have shown that mindfulness meditation can be as effective as prescription
painkillers, and can enhance the body's natural healing systems. Mindfulness can also reduce
the anxiety, depression, irritability, exhaustion, and insomnia that arises from chronic pain and
illness".
