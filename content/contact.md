Thank you for taking the time to read through these pages, if you think I may be
the right person to help you with your difficulties, please contact me now, to
arrange a brief informal chat at a mutually agreed time. This will give me a
broad understanding of what you want to work on and whether I can help. It will
also give you the opportunity to ask any questions and get a sense of whether
you feel we can work together before committing to your first appointment.
Feel free to call me, or if you prefer email me a summary of your current 
problem and we can take it from there. You can also fill out the contact form 
below.

I will endeavour to get back to you as soon as I can.

Sessions can be arranged either face to face or online, depending on your
preference.

Fees:    Â£70 per Therapy hour (55 mins) Payment by debit/credit card, bank transfer, or Paypal invoice. To be paid __one the day__ of therapy, before or promptly after the session.

#### Online therapy

When we arrange an appointment, I can email you a link, inviting you to our planned session.
Just click on this link at the agreed time and follow the instructions. I
primarily use Zoom, with Doxy.me as an alternative option.

Whatever system we choose please consider the right time and place for you to
take the call so you can have a degree of privacy and quiet, with little
interruption.

#### Cancellations or non attendance
Please to get in touch as soon as possible if you are unable to attend. For less than 24 hours notice I would ask you to pay 50% of the session fee.
