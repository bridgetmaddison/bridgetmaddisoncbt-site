Thank you for taking the time to read through these pages, if you think I may be
the right person to help you with your difficulties, please contact me now, to
arrange a brief informal chat at a mutually agreed time. This will give me a
broad understanding of what you want to work on and whether I can help. It will
also give you the opportunity to ask any questions and get a sense of whether
you feel we can work together before committing to your first appointment.
Feel free to call me, or if you prefer email me a summary of your current 
problem and we can take it from there. You can also fill out the contact form 
below.

I will endeavour to get back to you as soon as I can.

In line with the latest government social distancing advice, sessions for the
time beging take place remotely via Zoom or phone.

Fees:    Â£65 per Therapy hour (55 mins) Payment by debit/credit card, bank transfer, or Paypal invoice.

#### Using Zoom

When we arrange an appointment, I can email you a link, inviting you to our planned session.
Just click on this link at the agreed time, follow the instructions to download the App, then off we
go. You may need to click on 'Start Video' and or 'Start Audio' as you join the 'meetingj, shown
at the bottom of the screen.

Here is [a video explaining how to 'join a meeting'](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362193-How-Do-I-Join-A-Meeting-).
As with face-to-face sessions, confidentiality is extremely important, so it is worth considering
the best time and place to attend your session where you have quiet, privacy, and no
interuptions. See
[here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362723-End-to-end-Encryption)
for information on encryption used in Zoom, including support for end-to-end
encryption.

#### Cancellations or non attendance
Please to get in touch as soon as possible if you are unable to attend. For less than 24 hours notice I would ask you to pay 50% of the session fee.
