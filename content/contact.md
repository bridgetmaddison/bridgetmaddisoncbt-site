Sessions can be arranged either face to face or online, depending on your
preference.

Fees:    Â£75 per Therapy hour (55 mins) Payment by debit/credit card, bank transfer, or Paypal invoice. To be paid __one the day__ of therapy, before or promptly after the session.

#### Online therapy

When we arrange an appointment, I can email you a link, inviting you to our planned session.
Just click on this link at the agreed time and follow the instructions. I
primarily use Zoom, with Doxy.me as an alternative option.

Whatever system we choose please consider the right time and place for you to
take the call so you can have a degree of privacy and quiet, with little
interruption.

#### Cancellations or non attendance
Please to get in touch as soon as possible if you are unable to attend. For less than 24 hours notice I would ask you to pay 50% of the session fee.
