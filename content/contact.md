Thank you for taking the time to read through these pages, if you think I may be
the right person to help you with your difficulties, please contact me now, to
arrange a brief informal chat at a mutually agreed time. This will give me a
broad understanding of what you want to work on and whether I can help. It will
also give you the opportunity to ask any questions and get a sense of whether
you feel we can work together before committing to your first appointment.
Feel free to call me, or if you prefer email me a summary of your current 
problem and we can take it from there. You can also fill out the contact form

I will endeavour to get back to you as soon as I can.

#### Online therapy

When we arrange an appointment, I can email you a link, inviting you to our planned session.
Just click on this link at the agreed time and follow the instructions.

I primarily use [Doxy.me](https://doxy.me), a video communication platform designed for health
care professionals. It is a user friendly system with no requirement for you
download any software, Apps, or open an account. I have chosen this system to
ensure I meet the rigorous standards of online security expected by my
Professional Code of Conduct, Performance and Ethics.

Privacy and security features include:

* End to end encryption
* Meets GDPR and HIPAA standards (these are the privacy and security policies
  for Europe/UK and USA)
* Your personal information remains anonymous as no information is collected
  or stored following the call and any data transmitted during the call is
  permanently destroyed once it has ended.

Doxy.me works on tablet, phone, pc, laptop, as long as you can switch to these
browsers - Chrome, Firefox or Safari 11 or using Windows 10 Operating System (or
newer versions).

If you have any problems using this system with your equipment we can always
consider an alternative such as Zoom.

Whatever system we choose please consider the right time and place for you to
take the call so you can have a degree of privacy and quiet, with little
interruption.

#### Cancellations or non attendance
Please to get in touch as soon as possible if you are unable to attend. For less than 24 hours notice I would ask you to pay 50% of the session fee.
