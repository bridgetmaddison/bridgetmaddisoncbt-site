**Using Values, Mindfulness and Self Compassion to build a healthier, happier you.**

This is an 8 week programme underpinned by [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]({{< ref "more-about-act.md" >}})
or ACT.

We mostly know **HOW** to improve wellbeing but it can be so difficult to
start or sustain changes that would make a difference to our lives. This
workshop will:

* give you the tools to manage what gets in the way of looking after you
* Train you to harness your values as a motivator and to access your 'Kind
  Companion' to be your coach.
* Practical skills - mindfulness and compassion based exercises every
  session - change from the inside out!
* When we approach life in this way we are more able to handle stress, boost
  our mood and feel more confident

**This is a small steps approach, about integrating healthy practices into your
day to day life, chosen from a Wellbeing Menu** (From original idea by Professor
Kelly Wilson Co-Founder of ACT).

## The Wellbeing Menu

* Eat real food
* Move your body
* Give yourself sleep and rest opportunities
* Minimise exposure to toxins (physical and social)
* Engage in Meaningful Activity
* Practice Mindfulness
* Cultivate your Social Network
* Cultivate Self Compassion

I am passionate about  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, having seen the real
difference it can make to people's lives and have over 3 years experience of
devising and Facilitating an ACT Group Programme within the NHS.
