## Referrals


I accept referrals from: individuals, GPs, Employment Assistance Programmes,
and Insurance Providers (I am in the process of registering with these
organisations)


## Current


I have been working within Adult Primary Care Mental Services for just over 10
years, completing my Postgraduate Qualification in CBT in 2010. I now share my
time between NHS based work and offering two days of Private Practice from the
Wellbeing Centre In Malvern, Worcestershire.  I work on Friday and Saturday
Mornings, seeing people from aged 16 upwards.


Alongside my individual work with patients, I am a Clinical Supervisor within 
the NHS and as an external Supervisor privately.  I am also involved with the 
development and facilitation of group-work programmes, most recently devising 
and delivering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy groups, within the NHS.


I have a continuing commitment to best practice and regularly attend workshops 
and Courses which support my professional development and contribute to my 
ongoing Accreditation and Registration.


As an Accredited member of the British Association of Behavioural and 
Cognitive Therapists and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, my work is 
underpinned by the Professional Standards of Conduct and Ethics outlined by 
these established organisations. I am also a member of the Association for 
Contextual and Behavioural Scientists, which enables me to develop my practice 
within the ACT model. I receive regular Clinical Supervision.

children, though 3 are grown up!), dogs, and garden. I also enjoy getting out 
and about in our beautiful local countryside!
