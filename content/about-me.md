## Referrals


I accept referrals from: individuals, GPs, Psychiatrists,
[Bupa](https://finder.bupa.co.uk/Consultant/view/215281/mrs_bridget_maddison), Vitality 
Health, Nuffield Health, and others.


## Current

I am an experienced andÂ Accredited (BABCP) Cognitive Behavioural
Psychotherapist and Registered Mental Health Nurse. I have been privileged to
work with many people, empowering them to gain the skills and strategies required
to work through their problems using the CBT model. Research shows that the
success of any Therapy experience is very much dependent on the quality of the
therapeutic relationship. I believe I bring a non-judgemental, warm and kindly
approach to sessions, ensuring you feel safe and supported as we work together.

I have 15 years of experience of working within the NHS, completing my Post
Graduate Qualification in CBT in 2010. Alongside my individual work with Clients I
have enjoyed devising and facilitating an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
Group Programme (ACT) which continues to run across the County.

Following my decision to leave the NHS in 2018 I will work solely from the Beacon
Clinic from 2019 with individuals from 16 upwards.

I have experience of providing Clinical Supervision within the NHS and externally. I
currently offer Supervision for those interested in building skills within the ACT Model.
This can be face to face or on Doxy.me, Skype, or Zoom.
