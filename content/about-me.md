## Referrals


I accept referrals from: individuals, GPs, Psychiatrists, Bupa, Vitality 
Health, Aviva, Nuffield Health.


## Current

I have 15 years of experience of working within the NHS, initially as a Mental Health
nurse until completing my Post Graduate Qualification in CBT in 2010. Alongside my
individual work with Clients I have enjoyed devising and facilitating an Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy Group Programme (ACT) which continues to run across the
County.

Following my decision to leave the NHS in 2018 I now work solely from the Beacon
Clinic with individuals from 16 upwards and also offer a Group Therapy Programme - A
Wellbeing Therapy Workshop from the Beacon Clinic and in Worcester.

I have experience of providing Clinical Supervision within the NHS and externally. I
currently offer Supervision for those interested in building skills within the ACT Model.
This can be face to face or on Skype or Zoom.

I have a continuing commitment to best practice and regularly attend workshops 
and Courses which support my professional development and contribute to my 
ongoing Accreditation and Registration.


As an Accredited member of the British Association of Behavioural and 
Cognitive Therapists and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, my work is 
underpinned by the Professional Standards of Conduct and Ethics outlined by 
these established organisations. I am also a member of the Association for 
Contextual and Behavioural Scientists, which enables me to develop my practice 
within the ACT model. I receive regular Clinical Supervision.

adults from 16 upwards within the NHS and privately. 

When I'm not working or learning, I'm kept pretty busy with family, (I have 5 
children, though 3 are grown up!), dogs, and garden. I also enjoy getting out 
and about in our beautiful local countryside!
