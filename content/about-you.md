**About you and the problems you may be experiencing.**


My training and experience is in working with people from 16 upwards.


Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has been recommended in the NICE Guidelines, (The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) for the following:


* Depression
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
* Panic
* Phobia
* Health Anxiety
* Social Anxiety
* Generalised Anxiety Disorder or Excessive Worry
* Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)


I am experienced and trained in the individual evidence based protocols for each of these problems and this informs my practice. However, my experience of real people tells me that few people actually fit into these neat boxes and a broader or 'transdiagnostic' approach can be beneficial. 

My specialist interest area and an area in which I have considerable
experience is working with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and
particularly 'Pure O' (a form of OCD in which a person experiences obsessive,
unwanted thoughts without visible compulsions or rituals). There are many
subtypes within Pure O that span a wide range of themes. See
[here](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/symptoms-of-ocd/) for more information on this form of OCD.

I have a strong interest and considerable experience in the following areas 
for which an ACT approach has been found to be particularly beneficial: 

* Helping people manage their emotions 
* Managing Stress 
* Managing long term conditions eg Chronic Fatigue or Multiple Sclerosis
* Building Self Acceptance  to boost Self Esteem
* Mood difficulties following bereavement of loved ones or pets
* Binge Eating
* Shyness or social difficulties relating to autistic spectrum disorder traits.
* Coming to terms with change, for example, following divorce or retirement 


I also enjoy working with people who just need someone to help them step back, 
take stock and reconnect with their values.
