<strong>In today's modern world with life's many competing pressures and unwanted
changes, it's not unusual to feel worn down, overwhelmed, stressed, and
worried. You may feel like you are just existing, caught up in self defeating
behaviours or avoidance, struggling to get out of your head and on with your
life. I believe I can help.</strong>

<strong>Online and face to face appointments</strong><br/>
<p>
I am now offering some Face to Face appointments at the <a
  href="http://www.beaconclinic.net/">Beacon Clinic</a> which offers a COVID-secure environment. I
will continue to offer online sessions using the secure video platform
Doxy.me. See <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}contact">my contact page</a> for more information.
Research shows that
Online Therapy can be effective and I have completed recent training to
support me in finding creative methods of adapting 'in person' practice to
this format. We can discuss your preferred option at initial discussion by
phone or email.

<p>
<strong>More about me</strong></br>
I am an experienced and <strong>Accredited (BABCP) Cognitive Behavioural
  Psychotherapist and a Registered Mental Health Nurse</strong>. I have been
privileged to work with many people, empowering them to gain the skills and
strategies required to work through their problems. I specialise in
Third Wave CBT, particularly Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - a
form of CBT that uses Values, Self-Compassion and Mindfulness skills
to build a better life. I also work within the Compassion Focused Therapy
Model.
