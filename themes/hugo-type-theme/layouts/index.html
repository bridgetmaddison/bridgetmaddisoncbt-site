<strong>In today's modern world with life's many competing pressures and unwanted
changes, it's not unusual to feel worn down, overwhelmed, stressed, and
worried. You may feel like you are just existing, caught up in self defeating
behaviours or avoidance, struggling to get out of your head and on with your
life. I believe I can help.</strong>

<p>
I am an experienced and <strong>Accredited (BABCP) Cognitive Behavioural
  Psychotherapist, I am also a Registered Mental Health Nurse</strong>. I have been
privileged to work with many people, empowering them to gain the skills and
strategies required to work through their problems. I work from the Centre for 
Wellbeing in Malvern, Worcestershire.

<p>
<strong>Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</strong> is a scientifically proven talking
therapy that can help people with a wide range of difficulties. It is
recommended in the NICE guidelines (National Institute for Clinical
Excellence) as an effective treatment for Anxiety based problems and
Depression. CBT explores how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes impacts on
what you do and feel and how a greater understanding of these cycles and
processes can lead you towards solutions and change. CBT tends to be more
focused on the present but might also look at your past to help you
understand how your past impacts on the present.
</p>

<p>
Over recent years I have been increasingly drawn to <strong>Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT)</strong>. This falls under the 'umbrella' of CBT and is
often referred to as one of the 'third wave' family of Cognitive Behavioural
Therapies. What I love about ACT and why I've begun to use it more in my 
Practice, is that alongside its growing evidence base and great feedback from 
patients, I know how much more prepared I am myself to handle life's 
challenges, through using these skills and ideas!</p>
